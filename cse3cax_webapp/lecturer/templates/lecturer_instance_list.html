<!--
  Lecturer Instance Template
  =============
  This template displays the list of lecturer instances over a span of months and years in a scrollable table format. 
  The table includes a sticky header for the year and month labels and a sticky column for subject details, 
  ensuring important information remains visible while scrolling. 
  It dynamically updates the list of lecturer instances using HTMX to fetch content asynchronously, 
  providing a smooth and responsive user experience for managing lecturer rosters.
